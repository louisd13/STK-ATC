# ATC Project: Adapting SuperTuxKart for a visually impaired player

To access the official README of the game, please go to OFFICIALSTK_README.md.

This project has been conducted by Louis Duval, Anouk Paulino, Laetitia Schwitter and Marianne Scoglio, in the context of EPFL Assistive Technologies Challenge. The additional code has been produced by Louis Duval and Anouk Paulino.

## Introduction

In order to make the game accessible to our Challenger, we have added several features to allow us to retrieve important information about the current state of the game. In that way, we were able to transmit this information to the user via means other than visual.

Most of what we have added was directly related to the kart and therefore is located in the corresponding file. We will specify each time where the modification has been made.

## Additional features

### Rallye system

### Menu

### Text-To-Speech

### Guidance (test AI thing)

### Anything else?
